        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> Chop the onion, garlic, and carrot. Open the cans of crushed tomatoes and have the other ingredients ready.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the ground meat:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the ground beef (or pork) and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the vegetables:</strong> Add the chopped onion, garlic, and grated carrot to the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, until softened.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the liquids and seasonings:</strong> Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine (if using), oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the flavors meld together.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti:</strong> While the sauce simmers, bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions (usually about 8-10 minutes). Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine and serve:</strong> Serve the spaghetti on plates, topped with the Bolognese sauce. Optionally, sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
